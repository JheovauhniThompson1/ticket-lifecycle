For this initial step, I opened a ticket as the end user "Barbra Carson" with the basic issue summary "entire mobile/online banking system is down". Then, as a help desk agent, I'll sign in and handle the ticket.

During the osTicket Project, I had an issue in which I was fully locked out of all of my accounts, including the admin account. To resolve this, I had to enter MySQL and run code under "Query" to change my admin password. Afterwards, I sent a request to ost_staff to update the agents' passwords to ensure that the same problem did not occur again.

As Murphy, I signed into the Ticket and observed the issue. I then modified the Priority to Emergency, the SLA Plan to Sev-A, the Help Topic to Business Critical Outage, and the Assignee to Jessica Jones (Admin for the Online Banking Team). As Jessica, I logged in to handle the ticket.
