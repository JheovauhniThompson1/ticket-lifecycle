For this initial step, I opened a ticket as the end user "Barbra Carson" with the basic issue summary "entire mobile/online banking system is down". Then, as a help desk agent, I'll sign in and handle the ticket.

As Murphy, I signed into the Ticket and observed the issue. I then modified the Priority to Emergency, the SLA Plan to Sev-A, the Help Topic to Business Critical Outage, and the Assignee to Jessica Jones (Admin for the Online Banking Team). As Jessica, I logged in to handle the ticket.

I opened a new issue as Ken Carlton, the end user, with the simple statement "accounting department needs Adobe upgrade, broken". Once again, I'll log in as Agent Murphy and work on the ticket from there.

As Murphy, I worked the ticket to completion and set the SLA to Sev-C after determining that the issue at hand was not as serious as it appeared.
